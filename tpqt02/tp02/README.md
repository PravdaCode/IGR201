## About the Project
This project has the objective to improve our knowledge of Qt and interactive aplications, for that, we were asked to build a paint aplication using QT and CPP.

My project is composed of 3 classes and one enum and here you can find a short description off all of the parts of the program.

maindwindow: In here we create all the buttons and the settings features. Here we can also find the drawscreen as an object of the type draw.

draw: In here there's all the features that deals with drawing shapes, so it's this class that deals with mouse events, paint, painters, and editing shapes. Here you can find a vector of objects of type myshape, wich contains every shape that was drawn.

myshape: Here we deal with the particular caracteristics of a shape, we can resize, change colour and other caracteristics fo the shape.

Except the opening already presaved shapes, the program executes everything that was asked in the assignement.

## Drawing a line interactively 
Just select a shape and draw interactively clicking and draging the mouse.

## Specifying graphical attributes
If you click in the draw button in the menu you can chose the colour and the size of the stroke easily.

## Drawing other geometric shapes
Clicking in the buttons in the toolbar or in the menu Draw, you can chosse wich shape you'll draw

## Editing Shapes
If you double click a shape you can change it features, using the buttons in the draw menu or resizing interactively

## Saving 
You can save your image using the button save, when you try to exit the program will ask you to save it.
